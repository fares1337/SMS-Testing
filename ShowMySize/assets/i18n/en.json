        "p6": "Fast Fashion developed as a new way of living one’s apparel live. The value in this trend does not lie in the quality of the apparel piece but rather in its variety.",
        "p7": "Having a lot of diverse pieces of clothing, that you can mingle and match as well as replace whenever necessary, is the core of Fast Fashion",
        "p8": "Often this also includes, however, the need for cheap clothing. And those are usually produced in the mass and under non-sustainable conditions.",
        "p9": "Within 2018, the trend of fast fashion therefore underwent significant criticism for causing tons of waste and not looking after our planet and environment.",

        "p13": "&bull; The garments and fabrics are often made out of recycled materials and sustainable sources ",
        "p14": "&bull; The apparel does not harm the environment when thrown away",

Making clothes only for a smaller and very individual group of people, makes it possible to look after the production process. This is also called producing in lot size 1 and  is defined as one of the biggest upcoming trends. <br><br> However, this does not mean that ready-to-wear is automatically “the bad guy of fashion”. There are a variety of brands that focus on sustainable and individualized apparel. <br><br>Wait… individual but ready-to-wear: How is that possible?<br><br>You can go the middle-way.",
        "p11": "Mass customization seems like a contradictory. But actually it’s not. <br><br> The term “made-to-measure” refers to the fact that a designer is not starting your clothing completely from zero. Instead, the designer uses pre-defined patterns and individualizes them here and there according to your body. <br><br>Like this, the brand can increase the range from XS-XL to 16 or even 30 different sizes.  <br>Having different lengths and widths, depending on smaller or bigger bodies, makes it possible for the designer to adapt to your needs individually by keeping the production rather cost-efficient. Something that also reflects in the price. <br><br>Made-to-measure clothing is not as expensive as completely individualized, bespoke clothing. <br>This fact makes it possible fo everybody to have individual T-Shirt, Sweaters and pants. <br><br><br>Check out our partner brands – some of them offer exactly this service."
